# luhnatic

Luhnatic is a small wrapper exposing basical validation of alpha numeric strings against the [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm). Luhnatic is using a Base64 encoding for alpha numeric strings.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'luhnatic'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install luhnatic

## Usage

To check if a string is a valid implementation of Luhn:

```ruby
Luhnatic::Luhn.valid?("ErGLfG")
```

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
